# GeoPressureTemplate

Analysing geolocator data with pressure is full of potential, but the the path is long and the journey can be challenging. `GeoPressureTemplate` is a [Github repository template](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template/) for a startup R project to make that journey easier.

## What is this template and who is it for? :mag_right:

`GeoPressureTemplate` aims to help researchers analyse their geolocator data with [`GeoPressureR`](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/). It provides the backbone R code containing the folder structure and code to correctly label your data and produce basic trajectory figures. 

In essence, it contains the code from all the [GeoPressureR vignettes](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/) packaged in an `.R` file to make it easy for you to apply it to your own data. 

## What do you need to use this template? :computer:

- Geolocator data containing pressure, light and activity data.
- Have read the [GeoPressureR vignettes](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/) (:warning: You should be familar with the **full process involved** before starting with your own project)
- Basic R experience (I'm using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) syntax here).
- A [Github account](https://github.com/signup).


## Project structure :file_folder:

Following the recommendations of [rrrpkg](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg), the project contains:
1. Standard description files at the root (`DESCRIPTION`, `.Rproj`, `README.md`, `LICENCES`,...).
2. `data/` folder containing the raw geolocator data, the pressure and light labelled files and the data generated with the code from `analysis/`. Note that you could instead keep the geolocator and labelization files seperately in a `raw-data/` folder, following `usethis()` standard.
3. `analysis/` contains all the `.R` code used for your project.
4. `report/` reads the data generated and produces sharable results (figures, html page, manuscript, etc...).

## Where to start? :bulb:

### Create your project 

- Create your project repo by clicking on "[Use this template](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureTemplate/generate)" button on the Github page.
- Choose a project name (`my_tracking_study_name`) specific to your research. Note that `my_tracking_study_name`  will become the name of your folder on your computer too. Add a description of your study.
- Clone the repository on your computer
- Done! :tada:

### Make yourself at home :house:

- Rename `GeoPressureTemplate.Rproj` to `my_tracking_study_name.Rproj`.
- Open the R project file with RStudio. 
- Edit the `DESCRIPTION` file (see https://r-pkgs.org/description.html for details).
- Delete the content of `README.md` and start writing your research objectives, describing your basic data, method etc.
- Install the dependencies needed with

```
devtools::install()
```

- Delete the content of `data/` (but keep the directory tree). Put your PAM data in `data/0_PAM/` in a folder with the GDL_ID code (e.g. `data/0_PAM/18LX/`)
- Enter the information you already have about your track in the `gpr_setting.xlsx` spreadsheet. You can add new columns if needed.

## Start analysing the data :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Now that you are set-up, it's time to start the serious work. :grimacing: Follow the order of the `.R` code in the `analysis/` folder. They follow the same order as the vignettes (but with different numerotation).

|  GeoPressureTemplate analysis |  GeoPressureR vignettes  |
|---|---|
|  `1-pressure.R`  |  [Creating probability maps from pressure data](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/pressure-map.html) |
|  `2-light.R` |  [Creating probability maps from light data](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/light-map.html) |
|  `3-static.R` | [Preparing data for trajectory modelling](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/preparing-data.html)  |
|  `4-basic-graph.R` |  [Modeling trajectory with a graph](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/basic-graph.html) |
|  `5-1-wind-graph_request.R` |  [Improving the graph with wind - Request wind data on ERA5](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/wind-graph.html#download-wind-data) |
|  `5-2-wind-graph_transfer.R` |  [Improving the graph with wind - Download wind data on ERA5](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/wind-graph.html#download-wind-data) |
|  `5-3-wind-graph.R` |  [Improving the graph with wind](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureR/articles/wind-graph.html) |
|  `99-combined.R` |  Run all steps for multiple tracks. |

## Generate Report :page_facing_up:

Using the data generated, you can produce standardized reports in html and serve them on your github page repository. 
You can access the demo for 18LX at [https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureTemplate/].

The main idea is to produce report templates (`_name_of_the_report_template.Rmd`) which can be used for multiple tracks at once. We generate the HTML page for each tracks-reports separatly and puts them together into a website which can be serve on Github Page (and accessible for anywone!).

1. Developed your report template. Start from an exisitng one and change `gdl_id: "18LX"` to your species. You can visualize the output by [clicking the `knit` button in Rstudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html).
2. Edit the website configuration file `_site.yml`. (Search online if you need help)
3. Look at `make_reports.R` script to see how you can generate the HTML for multiple tracks and reports templates at once. 
4. Edit `index.Rmd` as you wishes
5. Run `{r} render_site('./reports')` (also provided at the bottom of  `make_reports.R`) to generate the full website in `docs/`.
6. Push your changes on Gihub and create your [Github Page](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/publish_website.html#github-pages).
